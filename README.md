# epilepsy_biomarker_simulations
R scripts belonging to paper: The importance of discriminative power rather than significance when evaluating potential clinical biomarkers in epilepsy research, Slinger et al. 2022. 

   * 0__biomarker_sim_set_1 -> first set of simulations with varying effect sizes and sample sizes
   * 0__biomarker_sim_set_2 -> second set of simulations with varying standard deviations

Those scripts form the basis of all simulation data and simulation figures presented in the paper.
