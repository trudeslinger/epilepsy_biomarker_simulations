# epilepsy_biomarker_simulations

## Description
R scripts belonging to paper: The importance of discriminative power rather than significance when evaluating potential clinical biomarkers in epilepsy research, Slinger et al. 2023. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/epd2.20010. 

   * 0__biomarker_sim_set_1 -> first set of simulations with varying effect sizes and sample sizes
   * 0__biomarker_sim_set_2 -> second set of simulations with varying standard deviations

Those scripts form the basis of all simulation data and simulation figures presented in the paper.

## Prerequisites
The scripts require:
* The R statistical software
